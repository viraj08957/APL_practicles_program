// A callback is a function that is 
// called when a task is completed, 
// thus helping in preventing any kind 
// of blocking and a callback function
//  allows other code to run in the 
//  meantime. Callback is called when 
//  a task gets completed and is the 
//  asynchronous equivalent of a function
